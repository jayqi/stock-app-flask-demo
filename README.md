# Stock App Flask Demo  
by [Jay Qi](https:jayqi.com)

A simple stock web app created with Python and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). Users can enter a company's ticker symbol to view price data from the past month.

Stock data is pulled from the [Quandle WIKI database](https://www.quandl.com/data/WIKI). The data is analyzed using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and plotted using [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/).
